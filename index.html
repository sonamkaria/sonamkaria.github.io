            <div id="name">Sonam Karia <br><br></div> 
             My passion for frontend engineering  was sparked when I got an opportunity to work alongside an extremely intelligent frontend engineer and I ended up assisting her in projects at work. Through this experience, I was able to develop a deep skill set in debugging the site and finding and fixing errors  in javascript resulting in delivering successful projects.That role inspired me to learn more about frontend engineering and I really became passionate about working in javascript, css and html. <br><br>I am currently a Digital Analyst at BeautyCounter where I am able to use my technical and communication skills to contribute to the success of my team. I am able to solve stakeholders immediate requests related to adding features to the site which saved them thousands of dollars and a headcount. I was called on by my supervisor because of my proven ability to solve any problem my way be it technical or analytical. <br><br>
             
             I believe healthy competition and innovation to be my biggest motivators.
